# VzPro
The VzPro 3D printer Project. Combination of https://github.com/pbsuper/VZTrident and https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330 as well as the TronXY X5SA Pro.
The VzPro Project was created by Jonas MÃ¼nz, better known as christmas3dprinting @ https://christmas3dp.cf. It's main purpose is to provide people who were unfortunate enough to have been sent an X5SA Pro instead of an X5SA when buying a used Amazon X5SA from Tronxy directly or for people who just had an X5SA Pro and want to super-upgrade it.

The goal:
The goal of the VzPro was re-using the X5SA Pro rails as much as possible, while having an awesome printer in your hands. Even making a custom 3D printed X rail as a replacement for the heavy stock rail, that re-uses parts of the stock rail. The stock guides of the rail can be extracted and are still good in my opinion. 

This project focuses on mainly that, as well as putting some aspects of the VzBot and VzTrident into the X5SA Pro to make it a hellish good printer.
The VzPro features:
- Triple Independent Z
- EVA2.4 Carriage Mod
- (Experimental) 3D printed X Gantry rail to save weight
- Pulley mounts mod
- VzTrident bottom skirt, made to fit X5SA 330
- Re-Use of Stock TronXY "OSG15" Rails
- Cheap watercooling (optional)
