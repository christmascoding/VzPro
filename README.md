# VzPro
The VzPro 3D printer Project. Combination of https://github.com/pbsuper/VZTrident and https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330 as well as the TronXY X5SA Pro
The VzPro Project was created by Jonas MÃ¼nz, better known as christmas3dprinting @ https://christmas3dp.cf. It's main purpose is to provide people who were unfortunate and were sent a X5SA Pro instead of an X5SA when buying a used Amazon X5SA from Tronxy directly or for people who just had an X5SA Pro and want to super-upgrade it.

The goal:
The goal of the VzPro was re-using the X5SA Pro rails as much as possible, even making a custom 3D printed X rail as a concept that may be possible. The guides on the X5SA Pro have potential in my eyes and should be re-used as much as possible. 

This project focuses on mainly that, as well as putting some aspects of the VzBot and VzTrident into the X5SA Pro to make it a hellish good printer.
The VzPro features:
- Triple Independent Z
- EVA2.4 Carriage Mod
- (Experimental) 3D printed X Gantry rail to save weight
- Pulley mounts mod
- VzTrident bottom skirt, made to fit X5SA 330
- Re-Use of Stock TronXY "OSG15" Rails
- Cheap watercooling (optional)
